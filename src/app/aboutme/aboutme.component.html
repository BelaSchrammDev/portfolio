        <div class="text">
            I am a Front-end developer based in Leipzig, Germany. I enjoy helping designers and companies bring their
            ideas into real life. I am looking forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web
            developer position.

            If you think Iâ€™d be a good match for your projects, contact me!
